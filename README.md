ExploratoryDataAnalysis
=======================

This repository relates to my course project submission for the Exploratory Data Analysis course offered by Coursera.  This readme is written with the requirements of the course in mind.

#Aim
The aim of the R-scripts here is to produce a number of plots of some household electricity consumption data, in line with the requirements for examination in the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Course.  The project contains four R-scripts, plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R.  They generate the graphics shown in Plot1.png, Plot2.png, Plot3.png and Plot4.png, respectively, provided that the file household_power_consumption.txt is located in the R working directory. The backgrounds are transparent in line with the course requirements.


## Plot 1
This plot shows the distribution of total annual household power consumption across the different households.

## Plot 2
This plot shows the variation in household power consumption across Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

## Plot 3
This plot shows the division in power consumption across different kinds of supplies across Thursday, Friday and Saturday in a typical week.

## Plot 4
This plot combines plot 1-3 in one graphic, and also adds a fourth plot, looking at the variation in voltage across Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
